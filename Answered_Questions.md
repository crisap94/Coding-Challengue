**How did you manage source control?**

R/ Along with the challenge I created a branch for each one of them with the purpose of not mixing the added features for being able to keep track of the timeline cleanly.

**What is the “single responsibility principle”? What's its purpose?**

R/ According to my knowledge its purpose relays on do not pretend to do everything on a single method, and give responsibilities, it helps to have a low coupling among the methods or classes, depending on what is being developed and the cohesion is highly impacted once this principle is applied.

**What qualities should a “clean code” have?**

R/ A "Clean Code" should be written semantically, letting the team understand it without any issue, also it has to be well documented, some times the semantic can just not be enough. The code must do what it suppose to do not more nor less.

**What is ACID?**

R/ ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. It refers to a standard set of properties that guarantee database transactions are processed reliably. Nevertheless, it is concerned about how a database recovers from any kind of failure while processing.

**What is the CAP Theorem?**

R/ At first Glance didn't know about it, after reading a while about it.

It is a high-level theorem used on distributed systems that certainly prove the implementation of 2 of the major characteristics that it must have, Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance.
